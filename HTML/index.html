      I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on the
      interaction of algorithms and networks, and the roles they play in
      large-scale social and information systems. My work has been supported by
      an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur
      Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a Simons
      Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty
      Fellowship, and grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur
      Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. I am a member of the National Academy of
      Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of
      Arts and Sciences.

            >This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach
            entitled Networks. The book, like the course, is designed at the
            introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites. To
            support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented
            with optional advanced sections.</em
